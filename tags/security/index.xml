This morning, I read a question about automatically rotating AWS Access Keys without having to go through the hassle of navigating the AWS console. There are some existing solutions already, but I decided to write a script since it was incredibly simple. The script could be packed up as a systemd/launchd service to continually rotate access keys in the background.
In the longer term, migrating my local workflows to aws-vault seems like a more secure solution.</description></item></channel></rss>
