>yewtu.be&lt;/a> and found it intriguing. It not only allows you to watch YouTube without &lt;em>being on YouTube&lt;/em>, but it also allows you to create an account and subscribe to channels without a Google account. What sort of wizardry is going on under the hood? It turns out that it&amp;rsquo;s a hosted instance of &lt;a
