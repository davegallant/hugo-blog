A homelab can be an inexpensive way to host a multitude of internal/external services and learn a lot in the process.

Do you want host your own Media server? Ad blocker? Web server?
Are you interested in learning more about Linux? Virtualization? Networking? Security?
Building a homelab can be an entertaining playground to enhance your computer skills.

One of the best parts about building a homelab is that it doesn't have to be a large investment in terms hardware requirements.

One of the simplest ways to build a homelab is out of a [refurbished computer](https://ca.refurb.io/products/hp-800-g1-usff-intel-core-i5-4570s-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-wifi-windows-10-pro?variant=33049503825943).
Having multiple machines/nodes has the advantage of increased redundancy, but starting out with a single node is enough to reap some of the benefits of having a homelab.

## Virtualization

Virtualizing your hardware is an organized way of dividing up your resources. This can be done with something such as a Virtual Machine or something lighter like a container using LXC or runC.
Containers have much less overhead in terms of boot time and storage allocation. This [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-virtual-machine) sums it up nicely.
