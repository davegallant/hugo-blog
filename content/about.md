ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software tinkerer with a passion for infra, security and self-hosting.

My primary motivation for hosting this website is to document my learnings and share them with others. I hope you find something useful here. Continuous improvement is what motivates me to keep learning.

I choose to self-host this site and other tools instead of relying exclusively on larger platforms because I believe in the open web. Interoperability is often not a primary concern for popular platforms today and I find that concerning. I first got access to the internet in 1996 and have seen it evolve into what it is today. I want to do my part to keep it open and free.
