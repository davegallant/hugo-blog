This website is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme is a modified version of [hugo-theme-gruvbox](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox). My general rule of thumb is to look for a gruvbox theme for most of the software I use since it delivers such a pleasant experience for the eyes.

The comments system is powered by [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances).
